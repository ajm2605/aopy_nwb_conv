  # We only run tests on Ubuntu.
  # macOS remains in the matrix so that it appears in the CI interface,
  # but is explicitly skipped because:
  # 1) macOS runners are much slower and often queue for a long time,
  # 2) the project does not rely on macOS-specific behavior,
  # 3) skipping macOS keeps CI fast and avoids unnecessary delays.
